<h2>MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENTS</h2>

<p>These songs can be used in all manner of entertainments. The
music is easy and both music and words are especially catchy. Children
like them. Everybody likes them. Sheet music. Price, 35 cents each.</p>


<p><b>HERE’S TO THE LAND OF THE STARS AND THE STRIPES.</b>
(Bugbee-Worrell.) A patriotic song which every child should know and
love. The sentiment is elevating. The music is martial and inspiring.
May be effectively sung by the entire school. Suitable for any occasion
and may be sung by children or grown-ups. Be the first to use this
song in your community.</p>

<p><b>I’LL NEVER PLAY WITH YOU AGAIN.</b> (Guptill-Weaver.) A
Quarrel between a small boy and girl. The words are defiant and pert.
The boy and his dog have been in mischief, and the small maiden poutingly
declares that she will never play with him again, but changes her
mind in the last verse. A taking little duet for any occasion, with full
directions for motions.</p>

<p><b>JOLLY FARMER LADS AND LASSIES.</b> (Irish-Lyman.) A decidedly
humorous action song prepared especially for district schools.
It will make a hit wherever produced.</p>

<p><b>JOLLY PICKANINNIES.</b> (Worrell.) Introduce this coon song
into your next entertainment. If you use the directions for the motions
which accompany the music, the pickaninnies will bring down the
house. Their black faces and shining eyes will guarantee a “hit.” The
words are great and the music just right.</p>

<p><b>LULLABY LANE.</b> (Worrell.) This song is one which the children,
once having learned, will never forget. The words have the charm
of the verses written by Robert Louis Stevenson. The music is equally
sweet and is perfectly suited to the beautiful words. It may be sung
as a solo by a little girl with a chorus of other little girls with dolls, or
as a closing song by the whole school.</p>

<p><b>MY OWN AMERICA, I LOVE BUT THEE.</b> (Worrell.) Here
is a song that will arouse patriotism in the heart of every one who
hears it. The music is so catchy that the children and grown-ups, too,
just can’t resist it. It makes a capital marching song.</p>

<p><b>NOW, AREN’T YOU GLAD YOU CAME?</b> (Guptill-Weaver.)
This is a closing song which is quite out of the ordinary. There is
humor in every line. The music is lively. Your audience will not
soon forget this spicy song for it will get many an unexpected laugh.
The motions which accompany this song make it doubly effective. For
any occasion and for any number of children.</p>

<p><b>WE ARE CREEPY LITTLE SCARECROWS.</b> (Guptill-Weaver.)
A weird, fascinating action song. You can’t go wrong with this song.
There are four verses and chorus. Complete directions accompany this
song so that it may be featured as a song and drill, if desired. For any
occasion and for any number of children.</p>

<p><b>WE’VE JUST ARRIVED FROM BASHFUL TOWN.</b> (Worrell.)
This song will bring memories to the listeners of their own bashful
school days. They will recall just how “scared” they were when asked
to sing or play or speak. The words are unusually clever. The music
is decidedly melodious. It makes a capital welcome song or it may be
sung at any time on any program with assured success.</p>

<p><b>WE HOPE YOU’VE BROUGHT YOUR SMILES ALONG.</b> (Worrell.)
A welcome song that will at once put the audience in a joyous
frame of mind and create a happy impression that will mean half the
success of your entire program. Words, bright and inspiring. Music,
catchy. A sure hit for your entertainment.</p>

<p><b>WE’LL NOW HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.</b> (Worrell.) This
beautiful song has snap and go that will appeal alike to visitors and
singers. It is just the song to send your audience home with happy
memories of the occasion.</p>

<h2>Snowbound for Christmas</h2>




<h2><i>Act I</i></h2>

<p><i>Scene.</i>—<i>A living room in the Simpson farmhouse. Toys,
books, etc., are strewn around untidily. Children play with
these when not talking. Doors Left and Right.</i></p>

<p><i>The curtain rises on Ma Simpson knitting by table in
Centre, and Pa Simpson reading the newspaper.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Sam, covered with snow</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—It’s still snowin’, Ma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span> (<i>not looking up</i>)—Yes, Sam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—It’s been snowin’ for three days, Ma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—Yes, Sam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—And tomorrow’s Christmas, Ma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—Yes, Sam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span> (<i>throws down paper</i>)—Do you suppose we don’t
know that it’s snowing, and that it’s been snowing for three
days and tomorrow’s Christmas. Can’t you tell us something
new?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—But, Pa, how are we going to get to town to buy
our Christmas presents and things?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span> (<i>gruffly</i>)—We can’t go and that’s all about it. The
horses couldn’t plow half a rod through these snowdrifts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—But whatever are we going to do for Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span> (<i>shaking her head</i>)—I guess we will have to do without
Christmas this year.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minerva enters</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—Do without Christmas! Oh, Ma!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span> (<i>brushing away tears</i>)—I’m sorry Minerva, but with
the twins down with the grippe last week and it snowing
so hard this week we couldn’t get to town and—and (<i>puts
apron to eye</i>). I feel every bit as bad as you youngsters.
I’ve always prided myself on giving you a happy Christmas,
and to think that I haven’t a thing ready this year. Oh, you
poor, poor children (<i>cries</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—Now, see what you’ve done. Run away children and
stop pesterin’ your Ma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span> (<i>kissing Ma</i>)—Never mind, Ma. We know it
couldn’t be helped. We can do one year without Christmas,
can’t we, Sam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span> (<i>patting Ma awkwardly</i>)—Of course. Don’t you
worry about us kids, Ma. We’ll get along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—Bless your dear, kind hearts. But the little ones,
the twins, how can I tell them that Santa can’t come this
year?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—Those kids have got enough toys as it is to last them
a life time. Look at this room. You’d think a hurricane
had struck it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—I know, I know. But they’ve been stuck in the
house so long that they’re bound to get their play things
around. It’s not the toys they need, but to tell them Santa
won’t be here. Oh, I can’t! I can’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—Perhaps, Ma, we older ones could make them
some presents. I could make a dandy nigger doll out of a
bottle and a black stocking. Sara Martin showed me how
to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—-I’ll go and get my tools right away and make a
cradle for the doll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—And I’ll give Jennie that ring that’s got too
small for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—I’ll paint my old sled over for Bobby and give
Bill my hockey stick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—That’s the idea! You kids have got good heads on
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—Come on, Minerva, let’s get busy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Exit Minerva and Sam</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—The dear children! There’s not a woman living
has better children than we have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span> (<i>blowing nose</i>)—You’re right there. I guess they
take after their ma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—How you do talk! And to think that my own children
have to teach their ma a lesson. Here am I moping
away because I hadn’t anything ready when I should be
hunting up and planning for them. What a silly old goose
I’m getting to be (<i>jumps up</i>). I’ll—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—Now, Ma, don’t go and call yourself names. You’re
simply tired out working yourself to death for these youngsters
and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—There’s that old Persian Lamb coat I got before I
was married. I’ll make muffs and capes out of it for Jennie
and Betty. It’s moth-eaten in spots, but there’s plenty
good fur left and Minerva can help me make them. And—and—for
Minerva I’ll (<i>rubs head</i>) oh, I know, I’ll make
Minerva a party dress out of my white silk wedding dress.
I ain’t never worn it much, and it’s almost as good as new.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—Not your wedding dress! You ain’t goin’ to cut
that up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—Why ain’t I? Laws-a-me, I can’t wear it anymore.
It wouldn’t come within five inches of meeting round the
waist, and it’s too old fashioned for Minerva to wear the
way it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—But your wedding dress, the dress you wore when
we two was made one, and you lookin’ like an angel
straight out of heaven in it. Oh, I couldn’t bear to see that
cut up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—Now, Pa, don’t you go and talk nonsense. I didn’t
know you had that much sentiment in you. To tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
truth I hate to have it cut up myself, but when it comes to
making that dear child happy I’d give her my head on a
charger if it would do her any good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—Who’s talkin’ nonsense now? Well, since you’ve
got the girls fixed up I guess I’ll have to think up something
for the boys. Blest if I know what I can give them
(<i>scratches head</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—It’s awful hard planning for boys. They ain’t so
easy pleased as girls with fixed over things. They’re more
for animals and such like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—There you’ve got it, Ma! I’ll give Sam that little
black colt all for his own. He’s just crazy about it and
Bill—let’s see—what can I give—Oh yes, there’s that Jersey
heifer that’s goin’ to be a sure-enough winner some day—I’ll
give him that. Then there’s Bobby, what in the dickens
can I give that tyke. He’s too young—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span> (<i>at door</i>)—Hush, I hear him coming.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Bobby rushes in</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobby</span>—Oh, Ma, what do you think! I found a dozen
eggs hid away in the hay-mow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—Why Bobby, whatever are you doing with your
Sunday trousers on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—How’d you happen to find the eggs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobby</span>—I was jumpin’ off the beam into the hay and I
landed right on top of them. Didn’t know they was there.
Gee, there was some spill. I guess them eggs was layed last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
summer, they smelt like it (<i>pause</i>). That’s why I got my
Sunday trousers on, Ma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—Well, run along now and see that you don’t get any
more eggs for if you spoil them trousers you go to bed.
You ain’t got any others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobby</span>—All right, Ma. I only wished we had a swing
in the barn like Pete Miller’s. Yuh kin go clean to the roof
in it. It beats jumpin’ in the hay all holler (<i>runs out</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span>—The very thing! I’ll put a swing up in the barn
for Bobby. I’ll give him a big bag of butternuts to crack
to keep him out of the way ’till I git it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma</span>—And I’ll get Minerva to make taffy to put the nuts
in (<i>exit Pa and Ma</i>).</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter Minerva with bottle and stocking, Sam with chest of<br />
tools and boards</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—I’m so glad I thought of this. It will be different
from any doll she’s ever had (<i>puts stocking on bottle</i>).
I’ll sew on beads for eyes with white paper pasted on for
whites and red for a mouth and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span> (<i>sawing wood</i>)—This will be some cradle when I
get done, you bet your life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span> (<i>severely</i>)—It’s sure awful, the slang you use.
You should cut it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span> (<i>jeeringly</i>)—I should cut it out, eh! Cut it out
isn’t slang! Oh my stars! (<i>turns handspring</i>). Say, Sis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
don’t you know that people in stone houses shouldn’t throw
glass?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—No, I don’t, and if I were you I wouldn’t start
quoting until I could get it right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobby</span> (<i>outside</i>)—I did hear Santa’s reindeer. I know I
did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span> (<i>jumping up</i>)—Here’s the twins. Hide your
stuff quick (<i>scramble</i>).</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter Bobby and Betty</i><br />

<p><i>Betty has black sticking-plaster over front teeth to hide them.</i></p>

cometh at night, don’t ee, Nerva?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span> (<i>lifting her on her knee</i>)—Yes, dear, when
you’re fast asleep in—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobby</span>—But I did hear him, I heard the bells jingle in the
roof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—Perhaps he’s around seeing if you’re good
children and don’t quarrel. You know he doesn’t give presents
to bad children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>—Uths hathn’t fighted for two days. Uths been
awful good, hathn’t uth, Bobby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bobby</span>—Yep, but if Christmas doesn’t hurry up and
come I’ll bust, I know I will.</p>

town. How are we going to buy—</p>

here Bill, I—I—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span>—Say, what’s the matter with you, Sam? Have you
got the palsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span> (<i>pulling him to front</i>)—No, but I wish you had.
Ain’t you got any sense? Do you want the kids to quit

have you all the pop-corn strings made for the tree?</p>

she can’t give us a real-to-goodness Christmas without

Christmas without regular presents won’t kill us. And
there will be heaps of fun makin’ them and keepin’ secrets

Nervy too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span>—What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie</span>—Well, you know that piece of green silk Aunt
Mary gave me for a doll’s dress? I’m going to make a bag
for Nervy to carry her crochet in and put featherstitching
on it with the purple sil—silk—silklene I’ve got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span>—Aw shucks, you haven’t time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie</span>—I have, too, it just takes a few minutes. Boys
don’t know nothin’ about sewin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span>—Aw, sewin’. Hockey beats that all to pieces.
What kin I give Sam? (<i>picks up magazine</i>). Oh, I know,
I’ll cut up the ads in our old magazine and glue them on

<h2><i>Act II</i></h2>

<p><i>Scene.</i>—<i>The Simpson living-room, tidied table pushed
back and Christmas tree decorated with home-made trimmings
and presents tied in various ludicrous parcels.</i></p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter Minerva carrying dishpan with note attached.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—I go first because I’m the oldest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie</span> (<i>outside</i>)—That ain’t no fair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span> (<i>finger to lips</i>)—Hush, you don’t want to wake
Ma. She didn’t come to bed until near morning (<i>puts dishpan
under tree</i>). There, that’s a promise it’ll be mighty hard
to keep for if there’s anything under the sun I hate doing
it’s washing dishes. Three times a day and there’s 365
days in the year, that washes, let me see—three times five is
fifteen, three times six is eighteen, and one to carry is nineteen,
and three times three is nine and one’s ten. Good
gracious, over a thousand times a year and eight in the family
means eight plates, eight cups, eight—a million dishes! Oh
dear, I wish our family was smaller.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter Sam with armful of wood</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—It takes a good sight longer for you to put a dishpan
down than for me to drop this wood (<i>slams it down</i>).
There’s the first load delivered on the contract. Gee, I wish
there was a gaswell on our farm. Perhaps I could persuade
Ma to use a coal-oil stove.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter Jennie with music roll</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie</span>—Oh dear, how I hate practising, but Ma says
she’s bound she’ll make a musicale out of me. Her chance
is better now than it ever was before (<i>puts it on tree</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span>—Aw, Jen, why didn’t you choose something quiet?
Do you want to drive us all insane listening to you running
up and down those everlasting scales?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jennie</span>—It’s your own fault. You said we had to promise
what we hate doin’ most and I’m sure—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerva</span>—I must get the twins up.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Enter Bill with book-bag</i><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span>—I had an awful hunt for this bag. Well, I know
one person who’ll be mighty glad I made this promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span> and <span class="smcap">Jennie</span>—Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bill</span>—The school-marm. And the strap will be gitten’ a
rest, too, I’m thinkin’. Gee, when I grow up and git in for
president I’m goin’ to have every school-marm in the States
put in jail who gives homework (<i>puts bag down</i>).</p>

<i>Enter Bobby carrying large bar of soap and Betty with an<br />

Jennie. I’m goin’ to wash them every mornin’ the water

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>—And you can’t call me theepy-head neither cos

<p><span class="smcap">Pa</span> (<i>reads</i>)—“I promise to fill up the wood box every
morning before school. Your lovin’ son, Sam.” Well now
if that ain’t an original Christmas-box and a mighty good
one, too.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
